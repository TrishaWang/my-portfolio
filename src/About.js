          Hi, Im Trisha, an artist at heart. Passionate about innovation,
          creating new things, and using my skills to improve quality of
          peopleâ€™s lives (like a fairy godmother of sorts? heh). If you are or
          you know of an organization whose vision aligns with mine, feel free
          to connect! I specialise in accessibility, performance and usability
          without sacrificing creativity. I'm a Frontend Web Developer building
          the Front-end of Websites and Web Applications that leads to the
          success of the overall product. Check out some of my work in the
          Projects section. I also like sharing content related to the stuff
          that I have learned over the years in Web Development so it can help
          other people of the Dev Community. Feel free to Connect or Follow me
          on my Linkedin where I post useful content related to Web Development
          and Programming I'm open to Job opportunities where I can contribute,
          learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills
          and experience then don't hesitate to contact me.
