          Hi, Im Trisha, an artist at heart. Passionate about innovation,
          creating new things, and using my skills to improve quality of
          peopleâ€™s lives (like a fairy godmother of sorts? heh). If you are or
          you know of an organization whose vision aligns with mine, feel free
          to connect! I specialise in accessibility, performance and usability
          without sacrificing creativity. I'm open to Job opportunities where I
          can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity that
          matches my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me.
